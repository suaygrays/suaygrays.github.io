As we all know, the world has entered a new era—one that challenges previous centuries with its technology, political complexity, and historic events. Generations Y and Z have witnessed defining moments that include both disasters and leaps toward the future, making the 2020s a period of transformation unlike any before. However, alongside these changes, the world now faces an entirely new and, dare I say, “cooler” challenge. You may assume I’m about to highlight trade tariffs and the U.S. betraying its so-called “bestie” Canada—and while that’s certainly a hot topic (thanks, Trump administration), there’s an even greater problem demanding the attention of the new generation: fractionation, a.k.a. deglobalization on steroids. 

Before we dive into why fractionation is both dangerous and, frankly, uncool, let’s clear up a potential misconception: fractionation is not just a fancy term for deglobalization. The two concepts, while related, are fundamentally different. Fractionation refers to the process of splitting into smaller, often opposing groups, while deglobalization is typically defined as the reduction of international trade and cross-border interaction. 

The key difference? Deglobalization suggests a simple reduction in global economic engagement, whereas fractionation is about something deeper: the fragmentation of entire geopolitical, economic, and even technological systems. While true deglobalization—cutting international ties entirely—is nearly impossible in our interconnected world, fractionation is already happening. Every major economy today operates with a high debt-to-GDP ratio, proving that national economies are not just national anymore—they are deeply entangled in a global web. Disrupting even a single trade link can trigger a chain reaction. If Turkey suddenly halts imports from the U.K., the ripple effects won’t just hurt those two countries—it could impact Argentina’s fragile economy or deepen deficits in the U.S. The world economy is a giant Jenga tower, and fractionation is shaking the tower as a whole… 

The question isn’t whether fractionation is happening—the real question is why it’s accelerating right now. The answer lies in a combination of political shifts, economic instability, and a changing technological landscape. 

For one, the political environment is shifting toward nationalism and protectionism. Across Europe, the rise of right-wing nationalist movements is redefining domestic and foreign policy, while in the U.S., the election of a tariff-loving president (yes, Trump I am talking about you!) has reshaped global trade dynamics. This is creating a world that is increasingly isolationist in practice, even if not in rhetoric. 

At the same time, economic blocs are evolving. BRICS, once an emerging-market experiment, is expanding its influence year by year, offering an alternative to traditional Western-dominated global systems. With new economic alliances forming and global institutions being challenged, we may be witnessing the birth of a new world order—one where nations prioritize self-interest over collective progress. The Cold War was an era of ideological division; fractionation could be its economic and technological sequel. 

But wait, there’s more! Fractionation isn’t just about trade wars and political rivalries—it’s also about the technological race that no one seems ready for. While governments pour billions into artificial intelligence and semiconductor industries, social systems remain woefully underdeveloped. The U.S.-China chip war, for instance, is a direct example of fractionation in action: rather than fostering global technological collaboration, nations are erecting digital walls, leading to a fragmented tech landscape where innovation is hindered by politics. 

And if that wasn’t enough, let’s talk about demographics. Population trends are shifting, and instead of addressing long-term socio-economic stability, governments are engaging in ideological battles over culture, family structures, and lifestyle choices. Will this lead to a generation that prioritizes individualism over societal continuity? Only time will tell. But until that old “time” answers this question we can see that Gen Y is adopting dogs and cats instead of producing child. 

The world isn’t ending—not yet, at least—but the pace of political and economic division is accelerating. Maybe the Doomsday Clock is onto something. Within a year or so, we will witness how global balance and stability are reshaped, and whether we will adapt or suffer from generational consequences. 

For now, fractionation deserves to be on everyone’s list—because whether we like it or not, the world is already shuffling it’s destiny.
